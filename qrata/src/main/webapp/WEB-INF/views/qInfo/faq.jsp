                    <p><span>What is the mission of <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span>?</span></p>
                    <p><span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> mission is simple:</p>
                    <p>
                      Save you time finding the most reliable, exceptional content while avoiding risky content.
                      The Internet is a vast library of important information. Unfortunately much of it is not
                      reliable or up-to-date, and thus risky to use. Additionally, there are lots of malicious
                      and bad services that could harm you. <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> job is to separate and identify
                      superior, need-to-know, high-utility content affecting your quality of life from all the
                      rest.
                    </p>
                    <p><span>What does the word <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> mean?</span></p>
                    <p>It is a word we created. The Q stands for quality and rata, as in Latin, stands for rating. Thus, together, <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> is meant to represent quality ratings - for you.</p>
                    <p><span>What is <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> exactly?</span></p>
                    <p><span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> is your "Ratings Library." Like a dictionary or encyclopedia, <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> is an on-demand reference resource focused on:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Need-to-know, high-utility topics important to your daily quality of life issues.</li>
                      <li>Aggregating the knowledge of both experts and users into one convenient site or app.</li>
                      <li>Helping you find the most reliable, accurate, and up-to-date content available faster and easier than any other service.</li>
                      <li>Where search ends and knowledge begins!</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><span>What are need-to-know, high-utility topics and how are they selected?</span></p>
                    <p>
                      Need-to-know, high-utility topics are the type of information you need in to improve
                      the quality of your life, personally or professionally. It is also the type of information
                      we all take for granted until we need it. Information you do not realize you need until an
                      important situation or decision arises that would benefit greatly from having it. When that
                      occurs the information is often needed immediately to help with the pending action,
                      decision or situation, especially if you think unreliable information could be potentially
                      risky or harmful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Consequently, this type of information is not usually something you would be readily
                      familiar with or would have saved in your list of favorites. Nor is it the type of content
                      you want or are able to invest a large amount of limited time randomly searching the
                      Internet and trying to identify quality content you know little about in the first place
                      and have limited skill to evaluate effectively. So, when you need this type of content you
                      want it fast and want to know it is reliable. <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> contracts with topic experts and listens
                      to user suggestions to identify need-to-know, high-utility topics and includes only the most
                      reliable content available.
                    </p>
                    <p><span>Who selects, evaluates and rates <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> content to ensure its recommendations are the most reliable available?</span></p>
                    <p>
                      <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> contracts with experts - real people - knowledgeable in a topic subject area and
                      who spend much of their professional life scouring the Internet to find the most reliable
                       accurate, up-to-date, quality - content within their area of expertise. These experts
                      carefully analyze and evaluate the quality of information offered in each relevant site,
                      app and video and rate each based on a list of criteria. Then, to insure our experts have
                      not missed anything important, <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> offers a cash reward to anyone who points out any
                      content  site, app or video - superior to what experts had selected
                      (click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKqvKXOEay0#t=82" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more).
                    </p>
                    <p><span>How does <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> help people find reliable content faster than other alternatives available?</span></p>
                    <p>Look at the alternatives to <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span>:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        Regular old search engines  are random algorithmic searches delivering a list of tens or
                        hundreds of thousands of possible, so-called  relevant results. Fact is the search engine
                        cannot evaluate the quality of content and so cannot indicate what is reliable, accurate,
                        or even current. Worse, between results that pay to be at the top of a search results list
                        and search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to trick the algorithm to be at the top,
                        relevant often means you get lots of results that are mediocre, junk and or outright bad.
                        Consequently, every time you need-to-know important, high utility content that might affect
                        the quality of your life, you must be smart enough in that topic and or be able to invest
                        enough time to evaluate every listed result and judge for yourself what is reliable.
                        <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> prescreen Internet content and only gives you the most reliable content available
                        every time.

                      <li>
                        Other rating services  generally these services (a) focus on products rather than
                        information, (b) require membership or charge you a fee, (c) use volunteers and not real
                        experts, and or (d) use people who have a conflict of interest in what they rate
                        recommendations. <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> is a free service focused solely on need-to-know, high utility
                        quality of life content selected and recommended by unbiased experts in a respective topic
                        and validated by users like you to ensure you can quickly find exception, reliable content
                        with absolutely no conflicts of interest.

                        Favorites list  often a list of favorites or number of apps is quite large.
                        Moreover, people rarely update or check to see if content they originally collected
                        to validate it is the most reliable and up-to-date content available. <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> provides
                        two unique benefits (1) a fast, free and easy way to check whether your favorites or apps
                        are your best option, and (2) gives you a special portable favorites list for unusual but
                        important quality of life content everyone needs periodically but rarely identify and
                        collect because it is a daily need.

                      Actually, <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> itself does not select any content. Rather, our experts and user
                      make the selections. Our experts are knowledgeable in their subject area and spend
                      much of their professional life scouring the Internet to find the most reliable and
                      useful content in that subject. Our experts start their selection process by screening
                      for content that warrants further evaluation as potentially superior and rates it for a

                    <p><span>How is information content for a site, app or video rated?</span></p>
                    <p>
                      <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> ratings are the result of a rigorous, patented evaluation process. It starts with
                      a basic criteria scorecard for evaluating a site, app or video operation, functionality,
                      accuracy, and so on. Next, experts weight each of the criteria to reflect its importance
                      in the overall evaluation of the topic. Then experts use the criteria to score the actual
                      content offered. An average score for all the criteria is then calculated to create an
                      overall rating for each content resource, which is then ranked against all content in
                      the specific topic area. The result is rank order of the most reliable sites, apps and
                      videos recommended by <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span>. In addition to user challenges, our team of editors
                      and quality control people audit this process continuously to ensure you obtain only
                      superior content results.
                    </p>
                    <p><span>What are the basic rating criteria?</span></p>
                    <p>
                      At a minimum, criteria include scope, coverage, accuracy, consistency, currency,
                      richness, completeness, size, navigation, searching and browsing, internal and
                      external links, output features, speed, availability, and privacy
                      (click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKqvKXOEay0#t=82" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more).
                    </p>
                    <p><span>Is the difference between the higher rated or ranked recommendations significant?</span></p>
                    <p>
                      First, and most important, <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> ONLY list on average the top 5 - 10 sites, apps
                      or videos in a topic area. In other words, we only offer you the best-of-the-best
                      content. So, while there is always some notable difference between content listed
                      within a given topic, a lower rating - thus a lower ranking - does not imply the content
                      resource is a less worthy of consideration. Rather, a higher rating, and thus ranking,
                      often implies a site, app or video has more of the elements, features and attributes
                      you would want if you had to choose just one site. Since all <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> recommendations
                      undergo the same evaluation process, most of the time the lower rated and ranked
                      content offers something unique or different that may be more specific or relevant to
                      what you are seeking. In other words, the content may have some strength or feature
                      that makes it valuable or special in comparison to other top-rated content within a
                      given topic area. This unique or specialize aspect is usually identified in the expert
                      content summary adjacent to the rating score and can be quite helpful.
                    </p>
                    <p><span>Why would a great site, app or video I know get a low rating (or not be included) in <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span>?</span></p>
                    <p>
                      It is hard to say in the abstract. <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> experts screen and evaluate many aspects
                      of many content resources before they recommend their top resources picks. Note,
                      however, with our patented evaluation process we do not ask experts to directly
                      compare and evaluate one content resource against another. Rather, we have
                      them compare each resource against the highest standard that can be set in each
                      topic area. Consequently, any particular resource may excel in some criteria and
                      be deficient in others. Since we limit the number of top-rated and recommended
                      resources listed in a given topic, many otherwise good or average resources do not
                      make it into our database. Key to the real benefit of our rating approach is that it
                      both reduces any unconscious bias an expert may have and assures you they are
                      objectively rating and recommending only the most reliable content possible. That
                      said, if you think there is a site, app or video that is superior to one of our listed and
                      recommended resources in a topic, we want you to tell us about it immediately. If
                      you are correct we will happily pay you a cash reward and email you our expert's

                    </p>
                    <p><span>Can I learn how and why an expert rated a particular site, app or video the way they did?</span></p>
                    <p>
                      Yes, of course. Click the rating score number next to a review. There you will find a
                      copy of the expert's specific rating for each criterion and read the evaluation. Note
                      that if you disagree with the expert you can rate the quality of their judgment on
                      each these criteria. Immediately after you submit your vote the consensus user score
                      instantly tabulated and displayed. <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> goal here, as always, is to transparently
                      assure you of the rigor and integrity of our evaluative process and thus reliability of
                      our ratings and content recommendations.

                    <p><span>How can the same site, app or video recommended in two different topic areas have different ratings?</span></p>
                    <p>
                      <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> experts evaluate and rate content based on how it compares to an ideal
                      rating for a specific topic area, not in the abstract or generally. In other words, the
                      content provided to you must be the best available for a specific informational or
                      situational need. For example, a health site may provide outstanding information
                      in the topic area of heart disease and receive an expert top rating. However, the
                      same site in the topic area of stomach cancer, while useful, may not provide the best
                      information compared to another higher rated resource in that topic area. This kind of
                      granular attention to topic specific criteria represents one of the unique benefits
                      of <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> service compared to any other service.

                      That said, our emphasis on experts reflects the fact that, you are seeking the most
                      reliable content. Thus, you want to have confidence that someone who knows the
                      topic thoroughly has systematically evaluated the relevant content before any specific
                      content is recommended. Someone who truly knows the difference between superior
                      content and content that is merely good or mediocre. Who knows the difference
                      between what is the most up-to-date content versus and what is stale. Few users have
                      this in-depth knowledge or engage in the type of exhaustive evaluative comparisons
                      as topic experts do.

                      Finally, as witnessed with many so called rating services, there is always a concern
                      about the potential for individuals or groups to seeking to skew or manipulate ratings
                      results in some way for some particular reason or benefit contrary to your interest in
                      objective reliability.

                    <p>
                      The need to update varies with each subject and topic. Since our experts are
                      intimately familiar with what constitutes new or better content that warrants updating
                      in their subject/topic area, we defer to their judgment generally. Indeed, our experts
                      monitor content in their respective subject/topics constantly and are required to
                      update recommendations as soon as possible when any consequential change occurs.
                      If, however, you know or see something that needs to be updated, please let us know
                      immediately. If you are correct, and we make the change, we will pay you a cash

                    <p>
                      Our experts, as part of their professional life, constantly search the Internet for new,

                    <p><span>What makes an expert downgrade the rating or recommendation of a site, app or video or eliminate it from <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> entirely?</span></p>
                    <p>
                      There are many possible reasons. These may include the discovery of a newer and or
                      better content, a previously excluded or low rated resource is improved significantly,
                      a resource adds a registration or fee requirement, a failure to stay current so content
                      and becomes outdated or irrelevant, adding too much clutter or advertising, the
                      release of private user information, too many dead links, and so on. It is important
                      to remember that things change. No listed content resource should rest on its past
                      accomplishments. Rather, we expect content providers should always strive to provide
                      the highest quality, most reliable content possible. Consequently, <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> constantly
                      monitors its content, ratings and recommendations to ensure they are all as up-to-date
                      and accurate as possible.

                    <p>
                      There are many organizations, sites and apps that offer various types of rating
                      services. However, very few offer free, unbiased ratings and recommendations from
                      genuine experts focused solely on need-to-know, high-utility quality of life content and
                      do not require membership or subscription fee. Moreover, our patent uniquely enables

                    <p>
                      The best search engines only search about half of the content on the Internet. So
                      unless you were an expert who dedicated his or her life to searching the Internet
                      for content in a topic area, you could never feel you had done an adequate job of

                        Even the best regular old search engines only search half of the Internet.
                        This means it quite possible that they will not find the most reliable content,
                        especially if it is new or not well trafficked. <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> experts go beyond the content
                        that search engines deliver and identify reliable content regardless of whether it
                        exists in a walled garden, social network, an app, a subscription or membership service,
                        and so on.

                      <li>
                        The only result of a regular old search engine query is a list of content that
                        might be  relevant. <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> gives you a list of content recommendations
                        guaranteed to be both relevant and reliable to the topic you want.

                        To discern if any of the content listed in a regular old search engine's
                        results - often tens or hundreds of thousands of possible sites, apps and
                        videos - is actually reliable is a time consuming, hit or miss exploration of good,
                        bad and irrelevant content. <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> content is always relevant to a search and limited
                        to manageable number of superior reliable content options.

                      <li>
                        Regular old search engines cannot evaluate whether the information in any
                        site, app or video is reliable. They are simply mathematical algorithm unable
                        analyze the reliability or quality of content. Consequently, as a user, you are
                        forced to independently evaluate each listed result for every search query you
                        make. Moreover, you must do this regardless of your knowledge, expertise,
                        ability or available time to make such evaluations. <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> experts evaluate
                        all topic relevant content, select, rate and recommend only the most accurate,
                        up-to-date and reliable content, excluding all the mediocre and junk content.
                        This save time and reduces potential risk and harm associated with using bad,
                        out-of-date or inaccurate content.

                        Companies specializing in search engine optimization (SEO) make a living
                        by manipulating regular old search engine algorithms. It is their job to give
                        their client content a higher placement in regular old listed search results
                        than they would normally deserve regardless of the merit of such a higher
                        ranked placement. Search engine optimization has no role in <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> ratings
                        or listings.

                      <li>
                        Most regular old search engines sell the top listing placement found on the

                        appropriate. <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> has absolutely no paid listings or paid placements so
                        only the top rated, most reliable content in any topic area is recommended to

                    <p><span>Can regular old search engines improve their service to provide the same kind of reliable results <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> offers?</span></p>
                    <p>
                      No, least not very quickly or easily. Regular old search engines are math equations
                      (software algorithms) designed to find the maximum quantity of possibly  relevant
                      results. Indeed, the sheer diversity of information categories, subjects, and topics
                      means there is no mathematical equation able to evaluate the accuracy, reliability
                      and quality of such diverse content throughout the entire Internet. Thus, discerning
                      the "quality" of content still requires real people. It takes human intelligence and
                      relevant expertise to evaluate and separate exceptional from the merely good and
                      mediocre content. So called  social search system are either volunteers who review
                      content or algorithms on steroids using personal information collected elsewhere
                      on the Internet. The obvious problem with both techniques is that there are no real
                      quality controls on such volunteers or personal data profiles to prevent bias, conflict
                      of interest and or misleading recommendations. Therefore, eventually, all regular old
                      search engines will need to add something like <span class="qrata">Q/Rata</span> because users like you will
